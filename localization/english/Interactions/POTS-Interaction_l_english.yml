 ninja_level.1.t:0 "Becoming a Genin"
 ninja_level.1.d:0 "Now that you have discovered your ability to wield chakra, you have decided to train yourselves in the arts of Shinobi to become a Genin, the first rank to be achieved by any Shinobi. Thus the lowest. There is a long road ahead of you if you wish to become a force to be reckoned with while traversing the world of Shinobi. Still, every journey has to begin somewhere and all of the start off with one step at a time."
 ninja_level.1.a:0 "Start training to become a Genin"
 ninja_level.11.d:0 "After three ardous years of work, blood and sweat, I have achieved all that one would dream a proper Genin to know, The Basics! By the sage, I have come to hate this word but endurance is but one of the keys I will need to advance even further. For now, I can proudly say to have completed the first chapter of my journey and successfully become a Genin."
 ninja_level.11.a:0 "I have become a Genin"
 ninja_level.2.t:0 "Become a Chunin"
 ninja_level.2.d:0 "The abilities of a Genin lay far beyond that of any mortals and yet scrape only the surface of the true potential of a Shinobi. The time has come to better yourselves and advance further. A Chunin is expected to work in cells during peacetime and in platoons during wartimes side to side with others of the same rank. A footsoldier if you will. Even though a footsoldier among gods. It is also the rank where most Shinobi remain at, where those truly realizing their potential split off from those destined for mediocrity. Again, among gods that is."
 ninja_level.2.a:0 "Start training to become a Chunin"
 ninja_level.22.d:0 "The basics were hard, the skills expected of a Chunin are harder. To think that as a Genin I felt so mighty, yet was nothing more than a fool in need of guidance and supervision. A Chunin is not all that much better, but a soldier can stand on his own where Genin can not. Advancing further will be the hardest challenge I will have faced until today. But then again, that is what I thought when I started on this path of becoming a Shinobi."
 ninja_level.22.a:0 "I have become a Chunin"
 ninja_level.3.t:0 "Become a Jonin"
 ninja_level.3.d:0 "In the world of Shinobi, a Chunin is a footsoldier, someone expendable and someone who still has not even reached the quarterpoint in regards to the power that still sits outside of his reach. Enough is enough. You are no common soldier, you are not someone who is expendable. To falter means to die, to take a step back means to be forgotten. The only way is forward. They say that the rank of Chunin is where those with potential split off from the riffraff, You say, that it is time for you to split off on your journey to realize your potential."
 ninja_level.3.a:0 "Start training to become a Jonin"
 ninja_level.33.a:0 "I have become a Jonin"
 ninja_level.33.d:0 "To the far east, they say that the common man is akin to a frog sitting on the bottom of a well. Only seeing the most tiny of pieces of the sky, not knowing what the scale of it truly entails. I have come to realize that I have been something of a frog sitting in a well myself. For even though I stand among the elite, among the most capable, I have also come to realize just how far the gulf between me and those that call themselves 'The Shadows' truly is. Learning humility will not stop me however. I have the means, I have the potential and I have the will to try and grasp for the stars... in the future. For now my rank is something I can be most proud of. To have become exceptional to those who are considered gods by those who were like me before the start of this journey."
 ninja_level.4.t:0 "The Shadows and I"
 ninja_level.4.d:0 "There are a select few who stand on top. A select few who are The Shadows. A Kage is a title given to only the strongest of the Shinobi. A title you are sure you are worthy of. In due time that is. Time you will need to train, to prepare, to plan, to expand your skills, to grow as a person and to truly advance into territory still unknown by most others. But when the time has finally come, you will grasp at Shadows and instead of fumbling blindly in the dark, you will grip onto them tightly and cloak yourself in them until you are one."
 ninja_level.4.a:0 "Start training to become a Kage"
 ninja_level.44.d:0 "The time is now! Countless years of laying the groundwork, countless years of planning and scheming, countless years of becoming stronger! In the past I promised I would grip the shadows and cloak myself in them. To become one with them. It is time to prove that im not one for empty boasts or lies. The peak is not as empty and desolate as one would think, the struggle far from over, but greater challenges present greater opportunities to learn and advance. I embrace this struggle, this everlasting test of endurance and willpower. I embrace these shadows and they cling to me, for I am finally one of them. I am a shadow on this world, I am a Kage!"
 ninja_level.44.a:0 "I have become a Kage"
 ninja_level.5.t:0 "Personal training"
 ninja_level.5.d:0 "Pushing oneself will bring one to their limits. Being pushed by others will catapult you far beyond those as long as it's done correctly. I cann see your potential and I will have you realize it. Be honored to be taught by me and think back to it when it is you who sees raw gems in need of polishing."
 ninja_level.5.a:0 "You will be trained to the level of a Genin"

Not only is almost the whole potential of the realm gathered here to be consolidated into as dense a core as possible, but it is also here, that the flames of our ambition are stoked. These people are my Shinobis, my shadows and my right hands. The stronger they are, the stronger the realm will be in the future."

 #Sharingan Level Interaction Events
 sharingan_level.1.t:0 "Training Your Sharingan"
 sharingan_level.1.d:0 "Now that you have unlocked your families ancient bloodline you decide to train yourself in the bloodline to try and obtain the legendery Sharingan of your ancestors. Much is said about these fabeled eyes. They are spoken of as bearer of ill omens and curses. But they also say that people who possess them are able to see through their every enemies move. On the battlefield as well as in matters of intrigue. They say that the devils with scarlet eyes never forget a face once they got a good look at it. If even a tiny kernel of truth rests in these tales, I would be a fool not to try and awaken these."
 sharingan_level.1.a:0 "Try to awaken your Sharingan"
 sharingan_level.11.d:0 "The training was exhausting. It is not clear what will lure the eyes out into the open, as everyone before me has had to live through different experiences. However, one constant in all those recountings is the presence of battle. A fight with ones life at stake, where a single mistake can result in you never be mistaken again. While I was reserved at first, my desperation grew with every failure I endured, until one day, finally I cast my fear to the wind and held nothing back. As did my enemies. At first I fought against my training-partners one on one, but when the thrill started to fade I had them come at me in pairs. When even that was not enough I faced off against three at once and against four after that. I remember only a whirlwind of blades, fists, and movement. When I finally came to my senses again I was surrounded only by men filled with fear and awe, flinching back when I let my gaze fall on them. All became clear when one of them gathered his courage, stepped forward and said. 'My Lord, your eyes...'"
 sharingan_level.11.a:0 "I have awakened the Sharingan."
 sharingan_level.2.t:0 "On the path to maturity."
 sharingan_level.2.d:0 "My eyes are a blessing. I can spot every blemish where others see perfection, I can see every contour when others only see darkness and I can see every person working the field where others only see the setting sun on the horizon. And yet, my eyes seem to be different from those that are spoken of. In the scriptures they are described as scarlet red with three spinning tomoe in one eye each. But when I look in the mirror I can only see a single one in each. Perhaps this is what they meant when they spoke of the maturing of the bloodline. Until now I assumed they meant the general awakening of the Sharingan but perhaps there is more to this than I first thought. I will continue training as I have done before, although I will need to find new ways to push me to my limits."
 sharingan_level.2.a:0 "Train to bring Sharingan to maturity"
 sharingan_level.22.d:0 "I was right! I did not notice it at first, but I keep improving way beyond what I was capable of every day. Yesterday was a particularly gruelling training session and when I woke up this morning, my eyes held two tomoe each! While they are apparently still not completely matured, the differences are as astounding as when I first awoke these eyes. I can barely even begin to try comprehend what these must be capable of once fully matured. One thing sure though, I cannot wait to finally awaken their full potential."
 sharingan_level.22.a:0 "Each eye holds a second tomoe"
 sharingan_level.3.t:0 "Matured to completion"
 sharingan_level.3.d:0 "My eyes are close to fully matures. Not much remains to spark the final change and awaken the full capabilities my ancestors spoke so much about. Where in the past I always dreamed of one day possessing this power, it has finally come to making this dream a reality. Before I may rest on my laurels I will have to first achieve it though. Training like nothing before lays ahead, but then again, training for th epurpose of betterment and advancement are a constant in the life of every Shinobi, no matter if they are descendants of a bloodline or not."
 sharingan_level.3.a:0 "Bring your Sharingan to full maturity."
 sharingan_level.33.d:0 "Should I ever meet my ancestors I will have no reason not to stand tall in their presence as an equal would. Every time I now truly look upon this world, time slows to a crawl, people become like open books and every challenge becomes trivial and mundane. I do not know why they say these eyes must be cursed, I say these eyes are a blessing. It almost seems too good to be true. But then again, jealousy and envy are sins for a reason and I can already start to hear whispers of people talking about my eyes when they think my back is turned and their gazes turn greedy when they see me demonstrate the visual prowess my bloodline and heritage grants me."
 sharingan_level.33.a:0 "My eyes are now fully matured."

 #Byakugan Level Interaction Events
 byakugan_level.1.t:0 "Training Your Byakugan"
 byakugan_level.1.d:0 "Now that you have unlocked your family's ancient bloodline, you decide to train yourself in the legendary Byakugan of your ancestors. Much is said about these mystical eyes. They are revered for their power to see beyond normal sight, offering a vision that spans nearly 360 degrees and penetrates any barrier, be it distance or physical obstruction. The Byakugan is spoken of not just as a tool for combat, but also as a weapon of unparalleled clarity, capable of revealing the flow of chakra and detecting the tiniest movements in an opponent's body. They say those who possess these eyes can see through any deception, reading their foes as easily as an open book. To ignore the gift of my clan would be to disregard the very power that has defined the Hyuga for generations." sharingan_level.1.a:0 "Try to awaken your Byakugan"
 byakugan_level.11.d:0 "The training was grueling. Mastering the Byakugan requires both physical and mental endurance. While many before me have unlocked the true potential of these eyes through intense focus and disciplined training, one constant remains — the battlefield sharpens one's abilities. Every encounter became a test, a moment where failure could mean defeat, not just in combat but in my path to mastering my bloodline.

At first, my movements were cautious, measured, but with each failed attempt to fully utilize my vision, my frustration grew. Desperation pushed me beyond my limits. I needed to see everything — the chakra networks, the faintest muscle twitch, the smallest hint of an attack before it even began. I sparred with my partners one by one, and soon that wasn’t enough. I pushed myself harder, facing two at a time, then three. By the end, it was a flurry of strikes and counterattacks, my Byakugan piercing through the confusion of blades and fists with perfect clarity.

When the dust settled, my enemies had fallen silent, their bodies and chakra laid bare to my sight. I could see their fear, feel their hesitation. As one of them stepped forward, trembling, he dared to speak: My Lord, your eyes... the Byakugan has fully awakened."
 byakugan_level.11.a:0 "I have awakened the Byakugan."
