#Bijuu & sealing
 search_the_beasts.1.d:0 "The nine tailed beasts, also known as the Bijuu, are incredibly powerful. Their power is so great that it can not manifest itself on this world alone. To facilitate this, they let themselves be sealed into human vessels. While it is impossible to control one of these beasts without being their respective vessel, I can still try to find out who and where these demons reside. Perhaps I am even able to bind one of the vessels to me. However, actively searching for them will draw attention, if not by others then at the very least by the demons themselves. A potentially risky endeavour. Not only that, but the chances of actually finding one of them are absolutely not looking in my favor."
 search_the_beasts.1.a:0 "No. This is far too risky."
 search_the_beasts.1.b:0 "I will try to find one of them."

 search_the_beasts.11.t:0 "Search for the beasts"
 search_the_beasts.11.d:0 "I will start searching for the tailed beasts, in the hopes of finding one of their whereabouts. For good or ill, knowing their location will be critical in terms of short- and longterm planning."
 search_the_beasts.11.a:0 "Tradtionally, the beasts are sealed away into children."
 
 SealingEvents.001.t:0 "Extract the Bijuu."
 SealingEvents.001.d:0 "Jinchurikis are humans that were outfitted with a seal containing one of the nine bijuu. The tailed beasts are demons made out of pure Chakra, thus, immortal and always reforming should one be able to destroy their physical bodies. The bearer of such a seal and demon gains an enormous boost in overall fighting-power and becomes unbelievably hard to kill, automatically making them key-players in many situations even without their express desire. While it is impossible to control those demons diretly and influencing their containers is no guarantee for compliance, it is possible to extract the beasts from their hosts and sealing them into a different vessel. In case of inanimate objects, these measures are only temporary but fulfill their role in containing a bijuu until a new host has been decided on."

 SealingEvents.002.d:0 "Possessing an object holding one of the tailed beasts, it is of the utmost importance to find a suitable host to transfer the demon into. Non-living objects detoriate fast when they are objected to these amounts of malevolent Chakra. The container breaking may not have any adverse affects besides the Bijuu inside having to reform again, but the amount of resources already invested into this project is too big to just let this opportunity slip away."
